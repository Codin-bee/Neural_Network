# Simple neuron networks for Java
Shortened name SNN4J.

## What is this library?
SSN4J is simple library for Java, which allows you to create simple neuron networks, train them and test them. Basic example of project you could do with this library is for instance number recognition AI using the mnist database.

## How do I download it?
1. If you use Maven, add to your pom.xml: 
```xml
<repository>
      <id>jitpack.io</id>
      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.Codin-bee</groupId>
      <artifactId>SimpleNeuronNetworks4J</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST-RELEASE</version>
</dependency>

```
2. If you use Gradle add to your build.gradle:
```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
		repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
		repositories {
			mavenCentral()
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

dependencies {
		implementation 'com.github.Codin-bee:SimpleNeuronNetworks4J:LATEST_RELEASE'
	}

```

Then reload your build system files changes and the library should be in your external libraries folder.

## How do I use it?
TUTORIAL AVAIBLE WHEN THE LIBRARY IS FINISHED NOW IT IS NOT GOOD IDEA TO EVEN USE IT
